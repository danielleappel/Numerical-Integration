# Numerical-Integration

The scripts

  - euler_backward.py
  - euler_forward.py
  - euler_backward_second_order.py
  - euler_forward_second_order.py
  
solve first and second order differential equations using Euler's forward and backward methods.
And the first and second order methods are compared in

  - first_order_compare.py
  - second_order_compare.py

respectively. 

Necessary packages & command line installation

  - Scipy (to utilize fsolve to algebraically solve equations
  
        python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose
  - Matplotlib to plot
  
        pip install matplotlib
  - Numpy to work with vectors
  
        pip install numpy
